# Inspiration Zone

## Executive Summary
  This document serves to provide Exeter with the business objectives, background, scope and requirements of the project to produce the web application, Inspiration Zone. In addition, this document will contain the delivery schedule, assumuptions, limitations and risks of the project.
  The document will be a core outline of the project and it's components.

## Business Objectives
  The value of creating Inspiration Zone is to provide a resource for students to collaborate on project ideas.  This is intended to provide a space for sharing files, screen shots and chat functions to coordinate.

## Background

With the success of Exeter, many students have inquired on how to find a way to work together with other students and inspire other students through hands-on teamwork. 

## Scope

Inspiration Zone is not a social media platform.  Inspiration Zone is a productivity platform that will allow students to collaborage on projects. There will be no integration with external social media platforms.  However, it will allow for exporting to productivity applications such as dropbox or google drive.

## Functional requirements

Inspiration zone is going to include a functional chat feature that will allow for the sharing of code with support of many programming languages.  It will allow for the creation of groups where users can be involved in multiple groups if desired.  Within each group, there will be the a group call functionality, the allowance of a meeting links for screen sharing as well as integration with Trello for project management.  In addition, each user will have a their own profile where they can list their skill set, contact information,  technology preferences, times available to work and personal settings for application theming, backgrounds and notifications.  There will be an option to set one's status to indicate if they are available or not.  The main section of the app- outside of groups, will be in a message board format where ideas can be posted.  Other users will be able to comment on the post with abilities to edit and tag other users.  This will be useful if a user finds an interesting idea and wants to involve other users they know or groups to work together.  The use of GIFs and other images types will be allowed in the posts to allow visual representation of project ideas.  

## Personnel requirements

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*

## Assumptions

## Limitations

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
