# Inspiration Zone

## Executive Summary
  This document serves to provide Exeter with the business objectives, background, scope and requirements of the project to produce the web application, Inspiration Zone. In addition, this document will contain the delivery schedule, assumuptions, limitations and risks of the project.
  The document will be a core outline of the project and it's components.

## Business Objectives
  The value of creating Inspiration Zone is to provide a resource for students to collaborate on project ideas.  This is intended to provide a space for sharing files, screen shots and chat functions to coordinate.

## Background

With the success of Exeter, many students have inquired on how to find a way to work together with other students and inspire other students through hands-on teamwork. 

## Scope

Inspiration Zone is not a social media platform.  Inspiration Zone is a productivity platform that will allow students to collaborage on projects. There will be no integration with external social media platforms.  However, it will allow for exporting to productivity applications such as dropbox or google drive.

## Functional requirements

Inspiration zone is going to include a functional chat feature that will allow for the sharing of code with support of many programming languages.  It will allow for the creation of groups where users can be involved in multiple groups if desired.  Within each group, there will be the a group call functionality, the allowance of a meeting links for screen sharing as well as integration with Trello for project management.  In addition, each user will have a their own profile where they can list their skill set, contact information,  technology preferences, times available to work and personal settings for application theming, backgrounds and notifications.  There will be an option to set one's status to indicate if they are available or not.  The main section of the app- outside of groups, will be in a message board format where ideas can be posted.  Other users will be able to comment on the post with abilities to edit and tag other users.  This will be useful if a user finds an interesting idea and wants to involve other users they know or groups to work together.  The use of GIFs and other images types will be allowed in the posts to allow visual representation of project ideas.  

## Personnel requirements

To complete the project, we will need a team of at least 8 developers.  2 of them need to be senior level and the others can be junior to mid-level. In addition, we need 2 UX/UI designers and 2 QA developers to ensure that quality of the work. The team selected for this project must dedicate 50 percent of their working time.  

## Delivery schedule

Phase 1 will be the design phase where we will focus on in-depth documentation of architectural specifications and user-interface designs as well as hardware specifications where applicable. The goal of this phase is to produce design documentation which can be turned over for implementation by the development team. 

Phase 2 will be the implemenation phase where all of the actual development will takes place. This phase belongs to the developers as they will take the project requirements and specifications, and code the application.

Phase 3 will be the verification phase and is dedicated to a series of quality assurance tests to validate that the application is working as designed and that all requirements have been met. This phase is often conducted by the QA team outlined in the "Personal requirements" section.

Phase 5 will be the Maintenance phase where the students will be using the developed application. Changes will be made to the system during this phase if any problems that are found due to improper requirements determination or other mistakes in the design process, or due to changes in the users' requirements.

## Limitations

Because team for this project will only be required to commit to 50 percent of their working time, they may only be available during part of the day to work on the project as the rest of their time will be use to their other responsibilities. 

## Risks

In the event that we lose any team members, it may cause a delay due to the small team and time commitment.  To mitigate this risk, we should have 2 back-up developers and 1 back-up QA developer.
